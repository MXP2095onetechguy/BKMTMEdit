### FAQs

##### What the hell is this? Why do you make another one?

> It's **better** than before! More extensible and neater code (try to make some dry, but it's still wet). Syntax Highlighting included. It is almost like an IDE, except it's not intended to be an IDE.

##### How to do stuff with this thing?

If you want to run this, use the JAR in the release:

1. Go to the release
2. Download the latest version
3. Download the JAR
4. Open the folder where you download the JAR
5. If it is the first time running it, follow this: Get it to make the config by running it.
7. Run the jar

If you want to build, read the [How to make file, this is the link to it](how2make.txt)


##### Why do I see MXPSQL.BKMTMEdit.utils and MXPSQL.BKMTMEdit.widgets packages

Those are reusable components that you can actually use!

##### Where is the javadoc online

No, first too lazy to upload it online and if I am not lazy, I am having trouble exporting the javadoc

##### Why does it say that the platform theme is broken

Find the code that will enable the platform theme and uncomment it. Build the project and see the problem.
